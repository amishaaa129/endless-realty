          <h2>🛤️ Our Founder’s Story</h2>
          <p>
            Sachin Sahu’s journey is not just inspiring — it’s transformational. Losing his father at a young age, Sachin was introduced early to the realities of life. But instead of surrendering to circumstances, he chose to rise. With limited resources and unshakable will, he completed his engineering education — a journey marked by silent struggles and sleepless nights.
          </p>
          <p>
            After gaining experience at reputed companies for 5 years, Sachin realized something vital: jobs gave stability, but not fulfillment. His dreams were bigger than his designation. He wanted growth, not survival. And that’s when he took a bold leap — into the unknown world of real estate.
          </p>
          <p>
            No background. No mentor. No capital. He started by helping people find homes for rent — door to door, client by client, learning the business with every step. Soon, confidence replaced confusion. From rental brokering, he moved into construction — learning not from books, but brick by brick.
          </p>
          <p>
            In just over a decade, Sachin built 200+ homes, sold 1000+ plots, and became a trusted name in the Indore realty space. Today, he’s leading the development of 6 townships funded by his own savings and the belief of close friends — a testament to the trust he’s earned.
          </p>
          <p>
            What sets Sachin apart isn’t just what he’s built — it’s how he’s built it: with integrity over shortcuts, people over profits, and dreams over doubt. Endless Realty is a reflection of Sachin’s core belief: “We don’t just develop land. We develop dreams & lives.”
